# Product Requirements Document: Task Master

## 1. Introduction
Task Master is an AI-powered task management system designed to streamline project planning, execution, and tracking for development teams and individuals. It leverages advanced artificial intelligence capabilities to assist users in breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks, analyzing complexity, and generating detailed implementation plans.

## 2. Product Goals
The high-level objectives of Task Master are to:
*   Enhance productivity by automating task breakdown and management.
*   Provide intelligent insights into task complexity and dependencies.
*   Offer a flexible and extensible platform for various project management methodologies.
*   Simplify the task creation and management process through intuitive interfaces.

## 3. Key Features

### Task Management
*   **Task Creation**: Users can define new tasks with titles, descriptions, and initial statuses.
*   **Task Updating**: Tasks can be modified to reflect changes in scope, details, or priorities.
*   **Status Tracking**: Tasks support various statuses (e.g., pending, in-progress, done, review, deferred, cancelled) to monitor progress.
*   **Dependencies**: Users can define dependencies between tasks, ensuring a logical workflow.
*   **Subtasks**: Complex tasks can be broken down into smaller, more granular subtasks for detailed planning and execution.

### AI-Powered Capabilities
*   **Task Generation**: Automatically generate initial task lists from high-level project descriptions (e.g., Product Requirements Documents).
*   **Task Expansion**: Expand high-level tasks into detailed subtasks, providing granular steps for implementation.
*   **Complexity Analysis**: Analyze the complexity of tasks and recommend further breakdown if necessary.

### AI Provider
OpenAI is the primary and currently supported AI provider for all AI-powered capabilities within Task Master. Previous integrations with other providers, such as OpenRouter, have been removed to streamline development, enhance stability, and focus efforts on a single, robust AI backend.

### CLI and MCP Tool Integration
Task Master provides a comprehensive Command Line Interface (CLI) for direct interaction and management of tasks. Additionally, it integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), exposing its functionalities as tools that can be utilized by external AI agents and systems, enabling advanced automation and extensibility.

## 4. Technical Considerations
*   **Technology Stack**: Task Master is built using Node.js, providing a robust and scalable backend for task processing and AI integration.
*   **Architecture**: The system features a modular architecture, which facilitates maintainability and allows for potential future integrations with alternative AI providers, should the need arise. However, currently, the focus is solely on OpenAI.
*   **Configuration**: Project-specific configurations, including AI provider settings and task management defaults, are managed via the `.taskmasterconfig` file, allowing for flexible and version-controlled setup.

## 5. Future Enhancements (Optional)
Potential future enhancements could include:
*   Integration with popular version control systems for automated task updates based on code commits.
*   Enhanced reporting and analytics dashboards for deeper insights into project progress and team performance.
*   Support for additional AI providers based on market demand and technological advancements.
*   A web-based UI for users who prefer a graphical interface over the CLI.
