# Plan for Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation and Commit

## Goal
Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Task Master project, reflecting the current state where OpenAI is the primary AI provider and the OpenRouter integration has been removed, and then commit it to a new branch.

## Steps

### 1. Construct PRD Content
Assemble the complete content for the `prd.md` file, ensuring all specified sections and details are included. This involves:
*   **1. Introduction**: Briefly describe the purpose of Task Master (an AI-powered task management system).
*   **2. Product Goals**: Outline the high-level objectives of Task Master.
*   **3. Key Features**:
    *   Task Management (creation, updating, status tracking, dependencies, subtasks).
    *   AI-Powered Capabilities (task generation, expansion, complexity analysis).
    *   **AI Provider**: Clearly state that OpenAI is the primary and currently supported AI provider. Mention that previous integrations (like OpenRouter) have been removed for streamlined development and focus.
    *   CLI and MCP Tool Integration.
*   **4. Target Audience**: Who is Task Master for (developers, project managers, etc.)?
*   **5. Technical Considerations**:
    *   Mention the use of Node.js.
    *   Note the modular architecture and extensibility for potential future AI provider integrations (but emphasize OpenAI's current sole role).
    *   Mention the use of `.taskmasterconfig` for configuration.
*   **6. Future Enhancements (Optional)**: Briefly touch upon potential future directions, but keep it high-level.

### 2. Create `prd.md` File
Use the `write_to_file` tool to create the `prd.md` file in the `docs/` directory with the prepared content. This step has already been completed successfully.

### 3. Signal Completion (Architect Mode)
Inform the user of the successful creation of the `prd.md` file using the `attempt_completion` tool. This will be done after the plan is written to `docs/plan.md`.

### 4. Commit Changes (Code Mode)
Switch to `code` mode to perform the git operations, as `execute_command` is not available in `architect` mode.
*   Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/prd-document`
*   Add the `docs/prd.md` file to the staging area: `git add docs/prd.md`
*   Commit the changes with the specified message: `git commit --no-gpg-sign --author="zen-ai-dev[bot] <210175559+zen-ai-dev[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>" -m "docs: Add initial Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\nCo-authored-by: daoch4n <daoch4n@gmail.com>"`
